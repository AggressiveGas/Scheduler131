-Side note from Ricky


One new package to install, here is the command:
npm install cookie-parser




--Added cookie parser and storing token on client.
--Basically I think its a working authentication.
--Delete user function now deletes user using token for authentication.



~Let me know if I messed anything up LOL, or if i'm doing the authentication incorrectly. I still struggle with the idea of it.
