-Side note from Ricky


[Final change after realizing error]
Don't need cookie-parser package, don't need it. Express handles it for me already. Also, Tokens are good enough I think.

-added authentication + delete user function (working)

~Let me know if I messed anything up LOL, or if i'm doing the authentication incorrectly. I still struggle with the idea of it.
